# Build Repository from Gitlab

This workflow is to run terraform pipelines using Gitlab CICD. This document covers the steps to setup Gitlab CICD and provides a high level overview of the stages involved:

## Prerequisites

* A Gitlab project containing the project-factory repository
* Available Gitlab Runners for the project either self hosted or the SaaS Gitlab shared runners.
* A working WIF provider, pool setup with audience as gitlab.com with neccessary attributes and linked service account with required permissions. For further details, please refer to the official [Gitlab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_services/google_cloud/)



## Overview
This workflow can execute terraform on different GCP projects depending on the branch on which push event is executed. Supports dev, staging and prod branches. The .gitlab-ci.yml file triggers the child pipeline on the respective branches and runs the workflow as specified in the workflow.yml file to execute terraform. All the three branches dev, staging and prod are linked to specific projects with DEV_, STAGE_, PROD_  CI/CD variables as specified in Gitlab project. For more information, see the setup section below


## Setup 

1. Update the CICD configuration file path in the repository
    * From the skunkworks Gitlab project page, Navigate to Settings > CICD > expand General pipelines 
    * update CI/CD configuration file value to the relative path of the gitlab-ci.yml file from the root directory

2. Update the CI/CD variables
    * From the skunkworks project page, Navigate to Settings > CICD > expand Variables
    * Add the below variables to the pipeline

## Overview of the Pipeline stages
The complete workflow consists of 4 stages and 2 before-script jobs

* before_script jobs : 
    * gcp-auth : creates the wif credentials by impersonating the service account. 
    * terraform init : initializes terraform in the specified TF_ROOT directory

* Stages: 
    * setup-terraform : Downloads the specified TF_VERSION and passes it as a binary to the next stages
    * validate: Runs terraform fmt check and terraform validate. This stage fails if the code is not run against terraform fmt        command
    * plan: Runs terraform plan and saves the plan and json version of the plan as artifacts
    * apply: This step is currently set as manual to be triggered from the Gitlab pipelines UI once plan is successful. Runs terraform apply and creates the infrastructure specified.
